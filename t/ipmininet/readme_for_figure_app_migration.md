# Generating results for the application-level connection migration.

Assuming ipmininet has been successfully [installed](https://ipmininet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) and picotcpls successfuly compiled (follow the main readme), the first step is to launch the network:

```
$ sudo python3 test_network_2path.py  
```

This script configures a mininet experiment with a client, a server, some routers and 2 IP-level paths. 

Open a terminal for the client and server from mininet's command line interpreter:

```
xterm c s
```

If for some reasons you have issues with xterm, you may also directly
launch the server/client scripts on the mininet CLI. (e.g., `s
./run_test_server_multipath.sh &`)

Then, on the server, do:

```
./run_test_server_multipath.sh
```

On client, do the following to launch the experiment:

```
./run_test_client_multipath.sh
```

This experiment will download a 60MiB file and perform two
application-level migrations during the download. The file
"tcpls_migration_goodput" should be generated and be available in the
current directory. If you do the experiment several times, be careful to
erase tcpls_migration_goodput or the next experiment's result would just
be appended to the file.

To capture TCP's throughput, open a client terminal:

```
xterm c
```
then on the client's terminal, launch tcpdump right before launching the
experiment above:

```
tcpdump -n -i c-eth0 -v > my_exp_tcpls_migration.pcap
```

kill it when the experiment completed. You can either 'quit' ipmininet
from the CLI or ctrl-c the tcpdump process.

Important! Save the timing events you see on the console. Those are
STREAM_ATTACH events, STREAM_CLOSE events, i.e., all events that the
script /pretty_plotify/plot_migration.py require. See
inside /pretty_plotify/plots.sh for example of plot_migration usage.


After the experiment, convert the .pcap using the python script convert_tcpdump.py: (use -oname tcpls_migration_pruned.log)

```
usage: convert_tcpdump.py [-h] -t T [-o O] -oname ONAME

Process a tcpdump -n trace and convert it to the following format: %H:%M:%S.%ÂµS IP_SRC > IP_DEST LENGTH

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -t T          Path to the _ascii_ trace file
  -o O          Output directorty, default .
  -oname ONAME  Output filename
```

The converted tcpdump file named tcpls_migration_pruned.log, and the
file tcpls_migration_goodput then needs to be feeded to the plot script.
You can simply move them in pretty_plotify/results/ directory on the
paper's repository. Do not forget to either edit the --event_at in
plots.sh, or to call yourself plot_migration.py with appropriate inputs.
